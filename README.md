# Haptic-feedback-as-sensory-substitution
The following repository is a project attempting to create an open source solution for using haptics as sensory substitution for people with peripheral neuropathy.
I have noticed that the solution of haptic feedback is something which has been proposed in literature for a while. However, offering up designs and code to build forward with is something that has been lacking. That's why I created this repository, to try and create a starting point for more creators to have a basis to start from. 

# system information
The system consists of a sensorpad that measures the pressure of the device and relays this through a wired connection to the controller board. 
The components used for the system are: 
- Force sensitive resistors
- Resistors (100kOhm)
- Teensy 3.2


The connections of the controller board can be seen on the schematic below

# Future development
Future development of the device will have to go into minitiurizing the electronics, testing various placements of the haptic feedback on the body.
